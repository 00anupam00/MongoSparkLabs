# MongoSparkLabs
## Initial Idea!
1. Connect to MongoDb
  1.1 Read from csv and Load to MongoDb
  1.2 Read from MongoDb
2. Use Spark for various transformations
3. Use Spark ML for various predictions[*future*]
4. Use Spark Streaming API to operate huge data from MongoDB[*future*]
5. Use Spark to ingest/migrate data from any other databases to MongoDb[*future*]
  5.1. Use custom libraries for this purpose to read the datasource.
6. Repeat from step 2.[*future*]
